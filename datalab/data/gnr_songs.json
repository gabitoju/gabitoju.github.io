        "lyrics": "We all come in from the cold We come down from the wire An everybody warms themselves to a different fire When sometimes we get burned You'd think sometime we'd learn The one you love is the one That should take you higher You ain't got no one You better go back out and find her  Just like children hidin' in a closet Can't tell what's goin' on outside Sometimes we're so far off the beaten track We'll get taken for a ride By a parlor trick or some words of wit A hidden hand up a sleeve To think the one you love could hurt you now Is a little hard to believe But everybody darlin' sometimes Bites the hand that feeds  When I look around Everybody always brings me down Well is it them or me Well I just can't see But there ain't no peace to found But if someone really cared Well they'd take the time to spare A moment to try and understand Another one's despair Remember in this game we call life That no one said it's fair  BREAKDOWN Let me hear it now BREAKDOWN let me hear it now Yeah BREAKDOWN Let me hear it now BREAKDOWN let me hear it now Get down with yo' bad self Alright  I've come to know the cold I think of it as home When there ain't enough of me To go around I'd rather be left alone But if I call you out of habit I'm out of love and I gotta have it Would you give it to me If I fit you needs Like when we both knew we had it But now the damage's done And we're back out on the run Fun how ev'rything was Roses When we held on to the Guns Just because you're winnin' Don't mean you're the lucky ones  BREAKDOWN Let me hear it now BREAKDOWN Yeah BREAKDOWN BREAKDOWN let me hear it now  There goes the challenger being chased By the blue blue meanies on wheels The vicious traffic squad cars are After our lone driver The last American hero The-the electric sintar The demi-god, The super driver of the golden west! Two nasty Nazi cars are close behind The beautiful lone driver The police cars are getting closer-closer... Closer to our soul hero in his soul mobile- Yeah baby! They about to strike, They gonna get him, SMASH! RAPE! The last beautiful free soul on this planet  But...it is writen if the Evil Spirit Arms the Tiger with claws Brahman provided wings for the Dove Thus spake the Super Guru Did you hear that"
